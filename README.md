# Omega Themes by Ratakor

To use this theme, add `THEME_NAME` and `THEME_REPO` arguments to your `make` command:
```bash
$ make THEME_NAME=omega_dracula THEME_REPO=https://github.com/Ratakor/Omega-Themes
or
$ make THEME_NAME=omega_troll THEME_REPO=https://github.com/Ratakor/Omega-Themes
^ don't work because of rgb's icons
```

omega_blue is omega_dracula but it's not finished yet 

however you can still use the dracula theme with the omega_dark icons
